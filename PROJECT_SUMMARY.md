### Client (client.js)
- TCP socket connection
- ANSI terminal rendering with colors
- Raw keyboard input handling
- Real-time display updates
- Player-specific view (own bots numbered, enemies as symbols)
- Buy menu rendering

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Color Scheme
- Player 1: Red (█)
- Player 2: Blue (▓)
- Player 3: Green (▒)
- Player 4: Yellow (░)
- Player 5: Magenta (■)
- Player 6: Cyan (●)
- Coins: Yellow ($)
- Effects: Player color (*, +, #)

### Display Format

4. **Read controls** on screen
5. **Collect coins** ($)
6. **Press P** to buy things
7. **Destroy enemies!**

## 💡 Tips for Playing

1. **Queue multiple moves** - Commands stack up
2. **Buy bots early** - Numbers matter
3. **Avoid collisions** - They're deadly!

5. **Upgrade armor** - Survive longer
6. **Spread out** - Cover more ground
7. **Watch the tick** - Time your moves

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Terminal must support ANSI colors
- Raw mode may not work in all terminals
- No persistence (game state lost on server restart)
- No authentication (anyone can join)
- Fixed arena size (40x20)
- Single server instance only
