# Queue Visualization & Collision Fix - Battle Bots v3.1

## Overview

Two important improvements to gameplay visibility and collision mechanics:
1. **Queue Visualization** - See your bot's planned moves
2. **Fixed Collisions** - Stationary bots now properly collide

## Feature 1: Queue Visualization

### Problem
With multiple bots executing queued commands, it was difficult to remember what actions were planned for each bot.

### Solution
Visual representation of the command queue shown for the selected bot.

### Display Format
```
Selected Bot: @ | HP: 10/10 | Ability: shockwave | Queue: 6 [###H##]
                                                              ^^^^^^^^
                                                       Queue visualization
```

### Symbols
- `#` = Movement command (W/A/S/D)
- `E` = Explosion ability
- `S` = Shoot ability
- `H` = Shockwave ability (H-pattern)

### Examples

**Movement Only:**
```
Commands: D, D, D, S, S
Display: [#####]
Meaning: Right 3, Down 2
```

**Movement + Explosion:**
```
Commands: D, D, Q (explosion), A, A
Display: [##E##]
Meaning: Right 2, Explosion, Left 2
```

**Movement + Shoot:**
```
Commands: W, W, W, Q (shoot), W
Display: [###S#]
Meaning: Up 3, Shoot, Up 1
```

**Complex Combo:**
```
Commands: D, D, D, Q (shockwave), A, A
Display: [###H##]
Meaning: Right 3, H-pattern shockwave, Left 2
```

### Implementation

Added to Bot class:
```javascript
getQueueVisualization() {
  return this.moveQueue.map(cmd => {
    if (cmd === 'ability') {
      if (this.ability === 'explosion') return 'E';
      if (this.ability === 'shoot') return 'S';
      if (this.ability === 'shockwave') return 'H';
      return 'Q';
    } else {
      return '#';
    }
  }).join('');
}
```

### Benefits
- **Plan Ahead**: See entire action sequence at a glance
- **Avoid Mistakes**: Catch errors before execution
- **Strategic**: Coordinate multi-bot actions
- **Clear Feedback**: Know exactly what's queued

## Feature 2: Fixed Collision Detection

### Problem
Collisions only occurred when both bots were moving to the same tile in the same tick. If one bot was stationary and another moved onto it, no collision occurred.

### Example Bug:
```
Before:
  Bot A at (10,10) - stationary (no queue)
  Bot B at (9,10) - moves right

After tick:
  Bot A at (10,10) - HP: 10 (no damage) ❌
  Bot B at (10,10) - HP: 10 (no damage) ❌
  Both bots at same position!
```

### Solution
Check collisions against ALL bots (moving AND stationary), not just moving bots.

### Fixed Behavior:
```
Before:
  Bot A at (10,10) - stationary
  Bot B at (9,10) - moves right

After tick:
  Bot A at (10,10) - HP: 0 (10 damage) ✅
  Bot B at (9,10) - HP: 0 (10 damage) ✅
  Bot B's move blocked by collision!
```

### Implementation

Modified `tick()` collision detection:
```javascript
// 1. Add stationary bots to position map
this.bots.forEach(bot => {
  const isMoving = moveIntents.some(intent => intent.bot === bot);
  if (!isMoving) {
    // Add to position map with current position
    positionMap.set(`${bot.x},${bot.y}`, [{ bot, stationary: true }]);
  }
});

// 2. Add moving bots to position map
moveIntents.forEach(intent => {
  // Add to position map with intended position
});

// 3. Check all positions for collisions
positionMap.forEach((botsAtPosition, key) => {
  if (botsAtPosition.length > 1) {
    // Check for enemy collisions
    const playerIds = new Set(botsAtPosition.map(b => b.bot.playerId));
    if (playerIds.size > 1) {
      // Damage ALL bots at this position
      botsAtPosition.forEach(b => b.bot.takeDamage(10));
    }
  }
});

// 4. Execute moves (only if no collision)
```

### Edge Cases Handled

**Case 1: Bot vs Stationary Bot**
```
Bot A stationary at (5,5) - HP: 10
Bot B moves from (4,5) to (5,5) - HP: 10
Result: Both take 10 damage, both die
```

**Case 2: Multiple Bots vs Stationary Bot**
```
Bot A stationary at (10,10) - HP: 20
Bot B moves from (9,10) to (10,10) - HP: 20
Bot C moves from (11,10) to (10,10) - HP: 20
Result: All three take 10 damage (HP: 10 each)
```

**Case 3: No Friendly Fire**
```
Bot A (Player 1) at (5,5) - stationary
Bot B (Player 1) moves to (5,5)
Result: No damage (same player), move cancelled
```

### Benefits
- **Realistic Collisions**: Can't move through stationary bots
- **Strategic Blocking**: Stationary bots create barriers
- **Fair Combat**: Attacking stationary bots has risk
- **No Exploits**: Can't phase through enemies

## Testing

### TDD Approach
Tests written first, then implementation:

#### Test 25: Stationary Bot Collision
```javascript
✅ Bot moving onto stationary bot causes collision
✅ Both bots take 10 damage
✅ Moving bot's position blocked
```

#### Test 26: Multiple Bot Collision
```javascript
✅ Multiple bots moving to occupied tile all take damage
✅ Stationary bot takes damage too
✅ All enemy bots at position damaged
```

#### Test 27: Queue Visualization - Movement
```javascript
✅ Movement queue returns visual representation
✅ Shows correct number of '#' symbols
```

#### Test 28: Queue Visualization - Ability
```javascript
✅ Queue shows ability with correct letter
✅ Format: ##H## for movement + shockwave
```

#### Test 29: Queue Visualization - All Abilities
```javascript
✅ Explosion shows as 'E'
✅ Shoot shows as 'S'
✅ Shockwave shows as 'H'
```

### Test Results
```
playtest.js:     29/29 tests PASSED ✅ (+5 new tests)
integration.js:  All scenarios PASSED ✅
test.js:         Original tests PASSED ✅

## Gameplay Impact

### Queue Visualization Impact

**Before:**
- Players forgot queued commands
- Hard to coordinate multi-bot strategies
- Mistakes happened frequently

**After:**
- Clear view of all planned actions
- Easy to plan complex combos
- Fewer execution errors
- Better strategic planning

**Example Strategy:**
```
Bot 1: [##E##] - Move into position, explode, retreat
Bot 2: [####S] - Move 4 times, then shoot
Bot 3: [#H###] - Move once, H-shockwave, advance 3

Coordinated attack with perfect timing!
```

### Collision Fix Impact

**Before:**
- Could move through stationary bots
- Stationary bots were safe zones
- Unrealistic gameplay

**After:**
- Stationary bots block movement
- Ramming stationary bots is risky
- Defensive positioning viable
- More realistic combat

**New Strategies:**
- **Bodyguarding**: Park bot to protect territory
- **Chokepoints**: Block narrow passages
- **Kamikaze**: Stationary bot as trap (enemy takes damage)

## Visual Example

### In-Game Display

**Before Queue Visualization:**
```
Selected Bot: @ | HP: 10/10 | Ability: shockwave | Queue: 6
                                                      ^
                                              Just a number
```

**After Queue Visualization:**
```
Selected Bot: @ | HP: 10/10 | Ability: shockwave | Queue: 6 [###H##]
                                                              ^^^^^^^^
                                                      See exact sequence!
```

### Planning Complex Actions

```
Turn 1: Press D, D, D (move right 3)
        Display: [###]

Turn 2: Press Q (use shockwave)
        Display: [###H]

Turn 3: Press A, A (retreat left 2)
        Display: [###H##]

Execute: Over next 6 ticks, bot will:
  Tick 1: Move right
  Tick 2: Move right
  Tick 3: Move right
  Tick 4: H-pattern shockwave! ⚡
  Tick 5: Move left
  Tick 6: Move left
```
