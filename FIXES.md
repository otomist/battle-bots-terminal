# Battle Bots - Bug Fixes and Updates

## Version 1.1.0 - Bug Fix Release

### 🐛 Issues Fixed

#### 1. Buy Menu Hotkeys Not Working
**Problem**: When the buy menu was open, pressing hotkeys like R, A, Q, F, H didn't actually purchase items.

**Root Cause**: The command handler was processing regular game commands (like 'R' for reset queue, 'Q' for use ability) BEFORE checking if the buy menu was open.

**Solution**: 
- Reorganized `handlePlayerCommand()` in `game.js` to check if buy menu is open FIRST
- When menu is open, all commands are routed to `handleBuyCommand()` immediately
- Client-side also updated to prioritize buy menu commands

**Files Changed**:
- `game.js`: Lines 162-214 - Reordered command handling logic
- `client.js`: Lines 83-122 - Updated input handling priority

#### 2. Missing Buy Bot Feature
**Problem**: No way to buy additional bots in the game.

**Solution**: 
- Added 'B' hotkey to buy new bots for $10
- Enforces maximum of 5 bots per player
- Menu closes automatically after purchase
- New bot spawns at random valid position

**Files Changed**:
- `game.js`: Lines 255-264 - Buy bot logic (updated price to $10)
- `client.js`: Line 245 - Updated buy menu display

### ✨ Changes Made

1. **Bot Purchase Price**: Changed from $15 to $10
   - Makes it easier to build army early game
   - Price is now 1 coin = 1 bot (balanced)

2. **Command Processing Order**: 
   - Buy menu now has highest priority
   - Prevents conflicts with regular game commands
   - P key toggles menu (works from anywhere)

3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - All docs updated to reflect $10 bot price
   - Buy menu shows correct hotkeys

### 🧪 Testing

Created comprehensive test suite:

1. **playtest.js** - Unit tests for all game features (20 tests)
2. **integration-test.js** - Full game scenario simulation

All tests passing ✅

### 📋 Test Coverage

- ✅ Buy repair (R) - Works correctly
- ✅ Buy armor (A) - Works correctly  
- ✅ Buy explosion ability (Q) - Works correctly
- ✅ Buy shoot ability (F) - Works correctly
- ✅ Buy shockwave ability (H) - Works correctly
- ✅ Buy new bot (B) - Works correctly at $10
- ✅ Maximum 5 bots enforced
- ✅ Menu toggle (P) - Works correctly
- ✅ Cannot buy second ability
- ✅ Insufficient funds handled correctly
- ✅ All abilities work in combat
- ✅ Collision damage works
- ✅ Bot selection works

### 🎮 How to Test

Run the automated tests:
```bash
node playtest.js          # Unit tests
node integration-test.js  # Integration tests
```

Or test manually:
```bash
# Terminal 1
node server.js

# Terminal 2
node client.js

# In game:
# 1. Collect some coins ($)
# 2. Press P to open buy menu
# 3. Press B to buy a new bot
# 4. Press R to buy repair
# 5. Press Q/F/H to buy abilities
```

### 🔍 Detailed Code Changes

#### game.js - Command Handler Refactoring

**Before**:
```javascript
handlePlayerCommand(playerId, command) {
  // ... other commands first
  if (cmd === 'r') {
    selectedBot.clearQueue(); // This ran even with menu open!
    return;
  }
  // ... buy menu checked LAST
  if (player.buyMenuOpen) {
    this.handleBuyCommand(player, selectedBot, cmd);
  }
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
handlePlayerCommand(playerId, command) {
  // Toggle menu first
  if (cmd === 'p') {
    player.buyMenuOpen = !player.buyMenuOpen;
    return;
  }
  
  // Buy menu commands - HIGHEST PRIORITY!
  if (player.buyMenuOpen) {
    this.handleBuyCommand(player, selectedBot, cmd);
    return; // Exit immediately
  }
  
  // Regular game commands only when menu closed
  if (cmd === 'r') {
    selectedBot.clearQueue();
    return;
  }
  // ...
}
```

#### client.js - Input Handler Refactoring

**Before**:
```javascript
// Regular commands processed first
if (key.name === 'q' || key.name === 'r' || key.name === 'p') {
  command = key.name; // These captured input before buy menu!
}
// Buy menu checked last
else if (this.gameState.player.buyMenuOpen) {
  if ('raqfhb'.includes(str)) {
    command = str;
  }
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Check buy menu FIRST
if (this.gameState.player.buyMenuOpen) {
  if (str && 'raqfhb'.includes(str.toLowerCase())) {
    command = str.toLowerCase();
    this.sendCommand(command);
    return; // Early return prevents double handling
  }
}

// Regular commands only when menu closed
if (key.name === 'q' || key.name === 'r' || key.name === 'p') {
  command = key.name;
}
```

### 📊 Impact

**Before Fixes**:
- ❌ Buy menu appeared to work but didn't
- ❌ No way to buy additional bots
- ❌ Commands conflicted with menu hotkeys
- ❌ 4/20 tests failing

**After Fixes**:
- ✅ Buy menu fully functional
- ✅ Can buy bots (B key, $10)
- ✅ No command conflicts
- ✅ 20/20 tests passing

### 🎯 User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Feedback**: Menu closes automatically after purchase
2. **Intuitive**: B for "bot" is easy to remember
3. **Balanced**: $10 price makes early game more interesting
4. **Reliable**: No more mystery why items won't buy

### 🚀 Ready for Production

The game is now fully playable with all features working as intended:
- ✅ All buy menu items purchasable
- ✅ Bot purchasing implemented
- ✅ No known bugs
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Documentation updated

### 📝 Notes for Future Development

The command handling architecture is now clear:
1. P key toggles menu (highest priority)
2. Menu open? → Route to buy handler
3. Menu closed? → Route to game handler

This pattern prevents conflicts and makes the code easier to maintain.
